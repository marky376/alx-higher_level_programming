**1. What a URL is:**
   - A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is an address used to locate a resource on the internet. It specifies the protocol used to access the resource (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), the domain or IP address where the resource is hosted, and additional parameters such as paths, queries, and fragments.

**2. What HTTP is:**
   - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, as well as how web servers and browsers respond to various commands.

**3. How to read a URL:**
   - A URL can be broken down into components:
     - Scheme (e.g., http, https)
     - Domain name (e.g., google.com)
     - Port number (if specified)
     - Path (e.g., /search)
     - Query string (if present)
     - Fragment identifier (if present)

**4. The scheme for an HTTP URL:**
   - The scheme for an HTTP URL typically starts with "http://" for unsecured connections and "https://" for secured connections.

**5. What a domain name is:**
   - A domain name is a human-readable label that corresponds to a specific IP address on the internet. It's used to identify websites and other resources.

**6. What a sub-domain is:**
   - A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. For example, in "sub.example.com," "sub" is the subdomain.

**7. How to define a port number in a URL:**
   - Port numbers are specified after the domain name, separated by a colon. For example, "http://example.com:8080" specifies port 8080.

**8. What a query string is:**
   - A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to the server as key-value pairs. It typically follows a "?" and may include multiple parameters separated by "&".

**9. What an HTTP request is:**
   - An HTTP request is a message sent from a client (e.g., a web browser) to a server, requesting a resource or action.

**10. What an HTTP response is:**
   - An HTTP response is a message sent from a server to a client in response to an HTTP request. It contains the requested resource or an indication of the outcome of the request.

**11. What HTTP headers are:**
   - HTTP headers are additional information sent along with HTTP requests and responses. They contain metadata about the message, such as content type, cache control, cookies, etc.

**12. What the HTTP message body is:**
   - The HTTP message body contains the actual data being sent in an HTTP request or response, such as the contents of a web page or form data.

**13. What an HTTP request method is:**
   - An HTTP request method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

**14. What an HTTP response status code is:**
   - An HTTP response status code indicates the outcome of an HTTP request. Examples include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), etc.

**15. What an HTTP Cookie is:**
   - An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the web browser. Cookies are used to remember stateful information or to track user activity.

**16. How to make a request with cURL:**
   - cURL is a command-line tool used to transfer data using various protocols, including HTTP. To make an HTTP request with cURL, you use the "curl" command followed by the URL.

**17. What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level):**
   - When you type "google.com" in your browser and press enter, the browser initiates an HTTP request to the server hosting the Google website. The server processes the request and responds with the Google homepage, which is then rendered by the browser for the user to interact with.
